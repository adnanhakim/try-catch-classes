# Try Catch Classes

## About

My first internship which came in the form of Try Catch Classes, which is an institution for budding developers located in Borivali, Mumbai. I was given the task of building an Android app from scratch showcasing all the technologies that they teach, the students that they placed and some of the technical tips they offer.

I was provided with all the assets and the data from their team and was given the task to combine them to produce the app as soon as possible, which I was able to do within a month.

This was my first experience at uploading an app to the Google Play Store. Hopefully, first of many!
